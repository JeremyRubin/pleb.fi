productive environment for everyone. This is an intelligent and well-intended
community, and we as the workshop committee are not inclined to tell people
what to do. To that end, this code of conduct spells out the behavior we
support and don&rsquo;t support at our events and by attending you agree to abide by
it.</p><p>The core of our approach is this:</p><p>We want to respect the privacy of all participants, so no photographs or
recordings are permitted without the consent of the photographed individual.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t condone harassment, undue interruption, or offensive behavior at our
workshop venues or anywhere. It&rsquo;s counter to our community values and
counterproductive in general. More importantly, it&rsquo;s counter to our values as
human beings.</p><p>Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands,
sexualized images in public spaces, intimidation, stalking, disruption of
sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or attention.</p><p>As an academic and engineering focused event, we do not allow public
promotional activities.</p><p>Besides the public presentations and the streaming sessions, all conversations
are held under the Chatham House Rule: participants are free to use the
information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the
speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed. Information
disclosed during a meeting may be reported by those present, but the source of
that information may not be explicitly or implicitly identified.</p><p>We&rsquo;re voicing our strong, unequivocal support of appropriate behavior by all
participants at our events. We invite you to help us make pleb.fi a place that
is welcoming and respectful to all participants, regardless of race, gender,
age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, national origin,
ethnicity, or religion. So that everyone can focus on the event itself, and the
collaboration and community richness that happens when we get together in
person, we will not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form—in
person or online.</p><p>We expect all participants—attendees, presenters, sponsors, and volunteers—to
follow the Code of Conduct during the workshop. This includes dialogue
conducted during the workshop, at workshop-related social events, at off-site
locations, in side conversations, as well as in related online communities,
chat and social media.</p><p>Participants who are asked by a participant, organizer, or other attendee to
stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Workshop
participants violating this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the workshop
and online fora without a refund, and/or banned from future pleb.fi events, at
the discretion of the organizing committee.</p><p>Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of the event staff. We
thank our participants for your help in keeping our events welcoming,
respectful, and friendly to all participants.</p><p>Thanks to the folks at O&rsquo;Reilly and Scaling Bitcoin, from whom this Code of
Conduct is heavily drawn.</p><h2 id=covid-19-event-liability-disclaimer>COVID-19 Event Liability Disclaimer</h2><p>In order to help mitigate the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and any resulting disease (together with any mutation, adaptation, or variation thereof, &ldquo;COVID-19&rdquo;) and other contagious illnesses, we ask that all attendees agree to the following:Stay-at-Home.
