    description: these two twitter legends are coming together for the first
      time ever IRL to debate (or will it be more of a friendly chat?) about
      the future of bitcoin. udiverse is well known for his laissez faire
      attitude when it comes to crypto -- if the people want to eat cake, let
      them eat cake. shinobi, on the other hand, is known for his 10000 RPM
      twitter tirades promoting shitcoin abstinence. what will happen when we put
      them 1v1? your guess is as good as mine.

      system? who may not have ever had a credit card or a bank account? how do
      we build for them? what tools will help bitcoin reach them?
