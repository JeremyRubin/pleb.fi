#### key dates

_see below for exact agenda._
- **tue may 16th morning-day: workshops + talks**
- **tue may 16th evening: hackathon kickoff**
- **wed may 17th morning: hackathon**
- **wed may 17th afternoon: hackathon judging & demos**

## what is this "hackathon" you speak of

it is the friends you make on the journey. we will have a <24 hour hackathon
sprint starting after the workshops (please sleep tho) for plebs to build and
showcase innovative ideas for the bitcoin ecosystem. don't have any ideas or
friends? the workshops will surely inspire.

there will be prizes. a bevy of them (subject to change till the event starts
-- we'll likely add some category prizes & nudge the main prizes if we have the
budget to).

| prize | cash | other |
| --------- | ----- | -----|
| 1st | $4000 | TBA |
| 2nd | $2500 | TBA |
| 3rd | $1000  | TBA |


## basic rules
no cheating allowed -- while it's OK if your submission is part of a larger
project or ecosystem (e.g., you build something using sapio or an extension to
sapio), the point is to try out new things and explore. there's no [firm
rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) here -- we'll know
cheating when we see it, and disqualify at our discretion. when in doubt, ask
an organizer if your project is in the spirit of the event.

we love teams; but we also love to see lots of projects. to strike the right
balance, teams may have up to 3 attendees.

to make the event more inclusive, you can also have a 'remote only' +1
teammate, just let us know in advance who they are. in the spirit of getting
real remote participants, we encourage remotes to be e.g. 2 hours+ away from
miami (if you see them during the event in person it's a disqualifier).
interested in being a remote hacker? either ask your friends attending or [sign
up](https://forms.gle/6ErdeQZAq466cR7t5) to share your info with teams.

#### How To Win

BUILD WHAT MAKES YOU THE MOST EXCITED YOU FREAK

but judging is subjective. at this event we're going to try to evaluate on 4 categories:

1) did you learn something new that others can learn from
2) does what you're building work towards solving a real unment need
3) is what you're building non-obvious
4) did you make use of something cool from any of the lectures throughout the workshops

if you just do something cool based on things you already know,
it's not a DQ, but we're going to value people trying out new things. 

we'll adjust these rules as the event draws near; ask any clarifying questions
in the telegram.
