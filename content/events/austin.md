- friday 20th august: work at your pleb job
- thursday 26th august: [bit block boom](https://bitblockboom.com/)

## what is this "hackathon" you speak of

it is the friends you make on the journey. we will have a 24 hour
hackathon starting after the workshops (please sleep tho) for plebs to
build and showcase innovative ideas for the bitcoin ecosystem. don't
have any ideas or friends? the workshops on saturday will surely inspire.

there will be prizes! $5000+cowboy boots to the top team, and a bevy of category prizes too.

no cheating allowed -- while it's OK if your submission is part of a larger
project or ecosystem (e.g., you are a c-lightning Dev and you build something
in c-lightning), the point is to try out new things and explore. there's no
[firm rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) here --
we'll know cheating when we see it, and disqualify at our discretion. when in
doubt, ask an organizer if your project is in the spirit of the event.

we love teams; but we also love to see lots of projects. to strike the right
balance, teams may have up to 3 attendees.

to make the event more inclusive, you can also have a 'remote only' +1
teammate, just let us know in advance who they are. in the spirit of getting
real remote participants, we encourage remotes to be e.g. 2 hours+ away from
austin (if you see them during the event in person it's a disqualifier).
interested in being a remote hacker? either ask your friends attending or [sign
up](https://forms.gle/pLbozeJTXuz6kpTdA) to share your info with teams.

## why are you charging money? not cool.
organizing events is hard. charging admission serves a few purposes: 1) we want
to ensure that our limited space goes to people who want to be there, no
flakes; 2) we're going to ensure there's good food available throughout the
event. we're running the event as not-for-profit, any excess funds will go to
supporting our non-profit partner or future events. if paying for a ticket is
an obstacle for your attendance, please let us know by filling out [this
form](https://forms.gle/66mMcK2gbtftwCLr9) and we'll work something out.
