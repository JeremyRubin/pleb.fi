##### other fun around the event

pleb.fi is the 4th/5th, but there's some other nearby bitcoin stuff the
6th-10th.

## what is this "hackathon" you speak of

it is the friends you make on the journey. we will have a <24 hour hackathon
sprint starting after the workshops (please sleep tho) for plebs to build and
showcase innovative ideas for the bitcoin ecosystem. don't have any ideas or
friends? the workshops will surely inspire.

there will be prizes. a bevy of them (subject to change till the event starts).

| prize | cash | other |
| --------- | ----- | -----|
| 1st | TBA | TBA |
| 2nd | TBA | TBA |
| 3rd | TBA  | TBA |


## basic rules
no cheating allowed -- while it's OK if your submission is part of a larger
project or ecosystem (e.g., you build something using sapio or an extension to
sapio), the point is to try out new things and explore. there's no [firm
rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) here -- we'll know
cheating when we see it, and disqualify at our discretion. when in doubt, ask
an organizer if your project is in the spirit of the event.

we love teams; but we also love to see lots of projects. to strike the right
balance, teams may have up to 3 attendees.

to make the event more inclusive, you can also have a 'remote only' +1
teammate, just let us know in advance who they are. in the spirit of getting
real remote participants, we encourage remotes to be e.g. 2 hours+ away from
austin (if you see them during the event in person it's a disqualifier).
interested in being a remote hacker? either ask your friends attending or [sign
up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciVZi5Ots5z5BXdPTxxd-ygPcFf5YpQWTDgglIi-_Y0hLOvw/viewform) to share your info with teams.

we'll adjust these rules as the event draws near; ask any clarifying questions
in the telegram.
