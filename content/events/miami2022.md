### if you dont come you will have to turn in your pleb card

come for 2 days of hacking, mentorship, workshops, and discussions on how to
contribute to bitcoin functionality accelerationism and build kickass
applications on bitcoin using sapio, taproot, ctv, and more. we'll also get
into how to get your project funded either traditionally or through new age
pleb means.

also food. some kind of party after. fun.

# APPLICATIONS: CLOSED

_note: we had a limited number of scholarships available to support women (with flights/hotels/childcare expense/etc) to be able to attend pleb.fi with thanks to our sponsors. if this applies to you, please fill out the form above! not a woman, but still need some help? let us know in the form and we'll do what we can!_

# convenient hotels to stay at

The hotels near miami springs slightly north of the airport will be pretty
convient. as would the Holiday Inn Miami West - Airport Area. but really you
can stay wherever. miami isn't too big. brickell is nice if you dont mind like
a 20 min uber. im staying in an airbnb.  but you probably dont care about that. 

the actually event venue we're keeping a bit hush for opsec reasons, if you
really gotta know DM me but we'll let you know sooner.

# prepping for pleb.fi / gimme homework?

the best thing you can do is to prep by learning rust.

you dont gotta be an expert, but a little bit goes a long ways to making you
able to follow along with all of the content.

[des](https://twitter.com/desiverse0/status/1506446065108590593) is organizing
some noobschool content / office hours leading up to the event that you're
encouraged to join.

[the rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) has some really great
exercises.

see also the resources & readings section at the end of this site.


### what the fuck is happening?
_to be tweaked as we confirm more content_


#### key dates

_see below for exact agenda._
- **mon april 4th morning-day: workshops + talks**
- **mon april 4th evening: hackathon kickoff**
- **tuesday april 5th morning: hackathon**
- **tuesday april 5th afternoon: hackathon judging & demos**

##### other fun around the event

pleb.fi is the 4th/5th, but there's some other nearby bitcoin stuff the
6th-10th.

## what is this "hackathon" you speak of

it is the friends you make on the journey. we will have a <24 hour hackathon
sprint starting after the workshops (please sleep tho) for plebs to build and
showcase innovative ideas for the bitcoin ecosystem. don't have any ideas or
friends? the workshops will surely inspire.

there will be prizes. a bevy of them (subject to change till the event starts
-- we'll likely add some category prizes & nudge the main prizes if we have the
budget to).

| prize | cash | other |
| --------- | ----- | -----|
| 1st | $5000 | TBA |
| 2nd | $1000 | TBA |
| 3rd | $500  | TBA |
| [bip-119 security bounties](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pN6YzQ6HlR8t_-ZZoEdTegt88w6gJzCkcA_a4IXpKAo/edit) | up to 5.5 BTC | TBA |


## basic rules
no cheating allowed -- while it's OK if your submission is part of a larger
project or ecosystem (e.g., you build something using sapio or an extension to
sapio), the point is to try out new things and explore. there's no [firm
rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) here -- we'll know
cheating when we see it, and disqualify at our discretion. when in doubt, ask
an organizer if your project is in the spirit of the event.

we love teams; but we also love to see lots of projects. to strike the right
balance, teams may have up to 3 attendees.

to make the event more inclusive, you can also have a 'remote only' +1
teammate, just let us know in advance who they are. in the spirit of getting
real remote participants, we encourage remotes to be e.g. 2 hours+ away from
miami (if you see them during the event in person it's a disqualifier).
interested in being a remote hacker? either ask your friends attending or [sign
up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciVZi5Ots5z5BXdPTxxd-ygPcFf5YpQWTDgglIi-_Y0hLOvw/viewform) to share your info with teams.

#### How To Win

look, judging is subjective. at this event we're going to try to evaluate on 3 categories:

1) did you learn something new that others can learn from
2) does what you're building work towards solving a real unment need
3) is what you're building non-obvious
4) did you make use of something cool from any of the lectures throughout the workshops

you can work on whatever you want! a really nice project built in python doing
something on the lightning network could win, absolutely. but, the focus of
*this* particular pleb.fi is on the bitcoin rust ecosystem, on smart contract
related stuff like sapio and miniscript, and on building decentralized
infrastructure. if you just do something cool based on things you already know,
it's not a DQ, but we're going to value people trying out new things. most importantly...

BUILD WHAT MAKES YOU THE MOST EXCITED

that matters most.


we'll adjust these rules as the event draws near; ask any clarifying questions
in the telegram.
