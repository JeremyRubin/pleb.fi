Let's give a big thank you to Tarun for that that was really, really awesome.
And are you gonna be able to stick around for a bit? I'll be around, I will
have some brainstorming session too. So you can catch them with your questions.
And he's @tarunChitra on Twitter. So definitely follow there and tweet at him
if you got any other questions.

I think that stuff is it's a pretty critical, like soul searching question for
the Bitcoin community. Because a lot of the way that the UTXO model is
structured, it's really difficult to get this pool to aggravate network
effects. It's something that I think about a lot, we can kind of make things
that have a fascimile of, you know, what's going on. Burak's work is fabulous
in that regard. But it's difficult to get that aggregate, you know, like all
capital works together at the same time kind of thing. It's a lot more when
you're building a Bitcoin protocol, like peer to peer finance, rather than,
like, the etheruem style like centralized DeFi where it's a contract, and but
it's the one contract, everybody interacts with. Bitcoin is much more
piecemeal. So picking that up, I think has some interesting scalability
questions. And hopefully, one of you here is going to fix all that.

I don't know if people have seen this, but I just wanted to pull it up really
quick. So I think this is like, on the existential question of, "why?", and
"should we do this?"

I look at this relatively often. This is crazy, right? The amount of fees
generated on Ethereum by both the uniswaps and by by Binance Smart Chain are
like more than Bitcoin, right? I mean, in like, like, what I think is what I
think is the useful lesson out of this page here is like, the one existential
question for Bitcoin is, can we build a sustainable block space market? Right?
When they figured it out? Like, somewhere in here is the answer, clearly? And
so I think it's, it's, that's why I think this is really important to start
thinking about and like trying and like that's why I brought up the question
like, it's not gonna look exactly the same. And the piecemeal way that we're
gonna have to pull it together is going to be different, but like, for you,
like us the answer to the one existential question, so I think it's important
to pay them

thank you, that's a meaningful comment.
