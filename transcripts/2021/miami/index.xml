&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s give a big thank you to Tarun for that that was really, really awesome.
And are you gonna be able to stick around for a bit? I&amp;rsquo;ll be around, I will
have some brainstorming session too. So you can catch them with your questions.
And he&amp;rsquo;s @tarunChitra on Twitter. So definitely follow there and tweet at him
if you got any other questions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think that stuff is it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty critical, like soul searching question for
the Bitcoin community. Because a lot of the way that the UTXO model is
structured, it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to get this pool to aggravate network
effects. It&amp;rsquo;s something that I think about a lot, we can kind of make things
that have a fascimile of, you know, what&amp;rsquo;s going on. Burak&amp;rsquo;s work is fabulous
in that regard. But it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get that aggregate, you know, like all
capital works together at the same time kind of thing. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot more when
you&amp;rsquo;re building a Bitcoin protocol, like peer to peer finance, rather than,
like, the etheruem style like centralized DeFi where it&amp;rsquo;s a contract, and but
it&amp;rsquo;s the one contract, everybody interacts with. Bitcoin is much more
piecemeal. So picking that up, I think has some interesting scalability
questions. And hopefully, one of you here is going to fix all that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>tradfi v.s. defi: they won't or they can't?</title><link>https://pleb.fi/transcripts/2021/miami/tarun/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pleb.fi/transcripts/2021/miami/tarun/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tarun-chitra--hahahugoshortcode14s0hbhb">Tarun Chitra &lt;button onclick="audio_skip(&amp;#34;0:00&amp;#34;)" >0:00&lt;/button>

&lt;p>Thanks, Jeremy, for the introduction. Yeah, so I think what I&amp;rsquo;m going to really cover is kind of like, what makes DeFi markets different than traditional finance markets and when you&amp;rsquo;re developing what, what things you should be thinking of. But I think part of that is actually looking at what the overall market structure looks like, and why some of these markets are just significantly more efficient, or have created, you know, this huge amount of demand over the last 12 months. But, you know, I think it kind of helps to first define what the things are. So, I wrote most of the presentations, while in the cab on the way here, so I apologize. But I will post these, and I will talk through it. So, so, apologies. So, you know, I think the first thing is, you know, DEFI is now unfortunately, a buzzword that is as bad of a buzzword, as you know, Ico or proof of stake, where it actually means like 5 million things. And it&amp;rsquo;s not, it&amp;rsquo;s not very useful or meaningful term on its own. But there&amp;rsquo;s sort of a set of criteria that I think, are kind of pretty important to defining what DeFi is. So at a very high level, I would say it&amp;rsquo;s credibly neutral, open and fair mechanisms for facilitating trade and leverage in composable, and purely algorithmic marriage.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
